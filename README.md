# Feature extraction and deep learning for visual place recognition

### About the project

Place recognition is one of the most essential subjects in computer vision, where the task is to correctly and efficiently recognize the location based on a given query image. The aim of the project was to obtain the best possible results when recognizing rooms in a given building with the use of the Siamese Network as an extractor of features from an image. The subjects of analysis and experimental work were various architectures of Siamese Networks, various loss functions used to train the network, such as contrastive loss or triplet loss. Also, different methods of generating pairs to learn the Siamese Network were tested. Based on the features of the images obtained from the Siamese network, classification was made using popular classifiers.
